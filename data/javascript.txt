a javascript library is a library of pre written javascript that allows for easier development of javascript based applications especially for ajax and other web centric technologies.webkit is a browser engine developed by apple and primarily used in its safari web browser as well as all ios web browsers. webkit is also used by the blackberry browser playstation consoles beginning from the the tizen mobile operating systems and a browser included with the amazon kindle e book reader. webkits application programming interface api provides a set of classes to display web content in windows and implements browser features such as following links when clicked by the user managing a back forward list and managing a history of pages recently html and javascript engine started as a fork of the khtml and kjs libraries from kde and has since been further developed by kde contributors apple google nokia bitstream blackberry sony igalia and others. webkit supports macos windows linux and various other unix like operating systems. on april 2013 google announced that it had forked webcore a component of webkit to be used in future versions of google chrome and the opera web browser under the name blink.webkit is available under the bsd clause license with the exception of the webcore and javascriptcore components which are available under the gnu lesser general public license. as of march 2013 webkit is a trademark of apple registered with the u.s. patent and trademark office.json javascript object notation pronounced also is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of pairs and array data types or any other serializable value. it is a very common data format with a diverse range of applications such as serving as a replacement for xml in ajax systems.json is a language independent data format. it was derived from javascript but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse json format data. the official internet media type for json is applicationjson. json filenames use the extension crockford originally specified the json format in the early after had been available as its informational specification since json was first standardized in as ecma rfcÂ 8259 published in is the current version of the internet standard std and it remains consistent with ecma that same year json was also standardized as isoiec the ecma and iso standards describe only the allowed syntax whereas the rfc covers some security and interoperability considerations.there are many javascript frameworks available. the intention of this comparison is to show some examples of notable javascript frameworks.json ld javascript object notation for linked data is a method of encoding linked data using json. one goal for json ld was to require as little effort as possible from developers to transform their existing json to json ld. json ld allows data to be serialized in a way that is similar to traditional json. it was initially developed by the json for linking data community group before being transferred to the rdf working group for review improvement and standardization and is currently maintained by the json ld working group. json ld is a world wide web consortium recommendation.react also known as react.js or reactjs is an open source front end javascript library for building user interfaces or ui components. it is maintained by facebook and a community of individual developers and can be used as a base in the development of single page or mobile applications. however react is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the dom so creating react applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing. react router is an example of such a library.ajax also ajax short for asynchronous javascript and xml is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. with ajax web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously in the background without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page. by decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer ajax allows web pages and by extension web applications to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. in practice modern implementations commonly utilize json instead of is not a single technology but rather a group of technologies. html and css can be used in combination to mark up and style information. the webpage can then be modified by javascript to dynamically display and allow the user to interact with the new information. the built in xmlhttprequest object or since the new fetch function within javascript is commonly used to execute ajax on webpages allowing websites to load content onto the screen without refreshing the page. ajax is not a new technology or a different language just existing technologies used in new ways.javascript often abbreviated as js is a programming language that conforms to the ecmascript specification. javascript is high level often just in time compiled and multi paradigm. it has curly bracket syntax dynamic typing prototype based object orientation and first class html and css javascript is one of the core technologies of the world wide web. javascript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. the vast majority of websites use it for client side page behavior and all major web browsers have a dedicated javascript engine to execute a multi paradigm language javascript supports event driven functional and imperative programming styles. it has application programming interfaces apis for working with text dates regular expressions standard data structures and the document object model ecmascript standard does not include any inputoutput io such as networking storage or graphics facilities. in practice the web browser or other runtime system provides javascript apis for engines were originally used only in web browsers but they are now core components of other runtime systems such as node.js and deno. these systems are used to build servers and are also integrated into frameworks such as electron and cordova for creating a variety of there are similarities between javascript and java including language name syntax and respective standard libraries the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.unobtrusive javascript is a general approach to the use of javascript in web pages. though the term is not formally defined its basic principles are generally understood to include separation of functionality the behavior layer from a web pages structurecontent and presentation and progressive enhancement to support user agents that may not support certain javascript functionality and users that have disabled javascript.a javascript engine is a computer program that executes javascript js code. the first javascript engines were mere interpreters but all relevant modern engines use just in time compilation for improved performance.javascript engines are typically developed by web browser vendors and every major browser has one. in a browser the javascript engine runs in concert with the rendering engine via the document object use of javascript engines is not limited to browsers. for example the engine is a core component of the popular node.js and deno runtime ecmascript es is the standardized specification of javascript ecmascript engine is another name for these engines.
